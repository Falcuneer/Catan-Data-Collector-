# Catan-Data-Collector-
The Catan Data Collector (CDC) is a C++ program that collects and interprets data gathered from playing the board game Settlers of Catan. The inspirtation behind CDC was to see if there was any correlation between the functions of the games. How did low numbers on clay (brick) tiles affect the economy and strategy of the game? How did the dice rolls affect the game? What were the dice rolls and what is the average roll? How did the intial placements affect the rest of the game? All these questions and more were things I was really interested in discovering. 

What I have now is crude, but the CDC still gathers some useful data. The CDC is a work-in-progress (WIP) and I hope to work on it more in the future, but this is what I have for now. 

It's important to note that this assignment wasn't assigned. As a student programmer it's very important to balance your academic programming with personal programming. That's how you learn. Pursue what you love to do and program it! You'll learn so much more.
